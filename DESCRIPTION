Description: hierProd is a hierarchical multi-stock surplus production 
    fisheries stock assessment model. The hierProd package is set up as
    a combination of a simulation model in R, and an assessment model 
    in TMB. The assessment model was tested as part of the CJFAS
    publication "Evaluating the role of data quality when sharing
    information in hierarchical multi-stock assessments, with an
    application to British Columbia dover sole" by S. D. N. Johnson
    and Sean P. Cox. There are functions included for fitting the 
    hierarchical model to real data as we did for dover sole.
